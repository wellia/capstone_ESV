Electricity distribution businesses report any electrical network-related incidents to Energy Safe Victoria as part of their regulatory obligations. The project aims on analysing the electrical network related datasets, to see any trends and patterns that lead to the electrical network-related incidents from occurring. This will help the general public, regulatory authorities and the state government to gain insights of the incidents and help in mitigating the risk of incidents. 

There are three main deliverables as follows: 
1.	Performing Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to provide insights and visualisations on the general profile of injuries, data profile of vegetation and animal or bird contact incidents and factors correlated to incidents involving ground fire (T2, 2020).  This trimester feature selection, data cleaning and feature engineering is performed to find more than one attribute to use for classification of incident categories.

2.	Building an accurate machine learning multi-class classifier to classify all categories of incidents using machine learning algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 

3.	Creating a classifier system that can categorise an incident within an acceptable level of error and further development of a web application.
