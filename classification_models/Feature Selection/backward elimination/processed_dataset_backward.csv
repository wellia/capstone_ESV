"United Energy was advised that an embedded network has been established at the Gateway Langwarrin Shopping Centre and Mornington Shopping Centre without a truck appointment as a failure of following industry policies.

19/11/2015 - Existing two shopping centres (Gateway Langwarrin Shopping Centre and Mornington Shopping Centre) converting to embedded networks. REC will require truck appointments to isolate the main switch board, re-supply new main switchboard via new CT meters in accordance with United Energy procedure/checklist.


ERM Business Energy raised a service order to accompany an EWR with Retailer Service Order Number: 201511013116.  They requested a NMI to be created to enable a metering installation request to be established for an embedded network. The contact is Electrical Engineer Filip Suleski from Nilsen on 0409 164 169 or filipsuleski@nilsen.com.au.  ERM advised further that a truck appointment is required in order for United Energy to proceed with the connection requests for both Mornington and Gateway Langwarrin Shopping Centres. 

United Energy approved the connection with NMI 6408201543 0 and 2001 Change Request ID: 836692107 created with EN code UGTLANSC1. 
United Energy left a voicemail for the REC Fillip regarding the go live date for the embedded network as a truck appointment is required after CT’s and metering are installed. 

01/12/2015 - ERM and United Energy were informed that Langwarrin went live on 25/11/2015 and a truck appointment is not required.  The REC was contacted who advised that he energised the site on 23/11/2015 and 78 Barkly St, Mornington (6408201539) on the 30/11/2015.  The REC was under the impression there would be no issues and turned the unmetered isolator on. 

Therefore, the embedded networks at Langwarrin and Mornington Shopping Centres have gone live without a service order / truck appointment being issued from the United Energy connections team. United Energy have not been paid for the back office work and these embedded networks are not set up in the systems and are not being billed. The back office fees are for the administration and truck appointment fees for updating systems and MSATS.  A truck appointment is always required for energisation of the parent NMI.

"On 19 February, 2016 a service order was issued for a meter and servicing crew to complete the connection of a new three phase supply to a new meter position and switchboard at 29 Callanans Road, Red Hill South.  The pole to pit dress up had been previously completed at this location on the 1 May 2015, with the supply energised to the pit.  (During the dress up works on the 1 May 2015 the connections from the three phase underground Fused Mains Junction Box to the overhead reticulation were transposed (Neutral connected to Blue phase)). 

Crew arrive on site and complete a Safety Assessment. 
•	Crew meet with REC (N Theodorakis) and Electrical Inspector (Kevin Toland) and are provided a copy of the Certificate of Electrical Safety, certificate number 4031 0954 6. 
•	Crew are advised by REC that the existing supply to the site is via a single phase connection to a separate meter board.
•	The crew inspected the new pit and confirmed the pit contained the three phase supply, connected and alive and the consumer mains were 35mm sized conductors. No single phase connection to the old meter was present at the new pit.  
•	The crew reportedly lifted the neutral at the meter board, by pushing it back towards the inside of the board (not bent away) and the actives were secured at the fuse base. Continuity testing on the consumer mains was completed with the NITP completed at the metal meter enclosure.
•	Crew confirmed with the REC and Electrical Inspector that it was okay to make the connections at the pit.  
•	The disconnected neutral conductor had moved and was under the neutral link plate.
Note: At this point in time the neutral and earthing system on the property were live.  
•	The crew proceeded to pack up their tools and equipment at the pit and move the truck to the pole in position ready to isolate the existing single phase supply 
•	Crew members return to the meter board to complete the testing.
•	Line Worker sees the neutral is in position behind the link and automatically moves to the testing mode of completing testing at the meter position and inserts the fuses.  
Note: The act of inserting the fuses created a situation where the phase to phase was present in the premises and therefore 415Volts at the connected appliances.
The Line Worker completing the testing believed the main switch on the switchboard was in the “OFF” position (possibly looking at the auto change over switch for the inbuilt generator).  However, following the incident it has been recognised the main switch was in the “ON” position.
•	Line Worker identifies only two of the three phases are present at the meter.
•	Line Worker uses neon tester and tests voltages between phases, indicating 415V phase to neutral.
•	Line Worker removes the neutral from behind the neutral bar and a spark occurs.
•	It is assumed the Line Worker also removed the fuses at some point  (either before or after the neutral was lifted).  Line Worker unable to clearly recall sequence of events to confirm.
•	Line Workers return to the pit to confirm correct connections.
•	Line workers set up the EWP and Line Worker ascends the pole to inspect the overhead connections where, the transposed blue phase and neutral conductors are identified.

Final report:
DAO attended site 0915hrs. Balloon operator ""RICHARD"" (0412066 666) from ""PICTURE THIS BALLOON CO"" (03 9429 0277).

Richard described coming in to land and seeing the HV line between poles 1008468 and 1008471, however he did not see the line between poles 1032877 and 1033055. According to Richard, the balloon was on the ground skidding along when they stopped more abruptly than usual. When Richard got out of the balloon he saw the balloon hanging over the HV Line.

The DAO measured the height of the HV line after the balloon had been removed and this was 28.8m. Speaking with Richard, the balloon and basket setup is 35m tall. 

The HV was still in the air and there was no visible damage from the DAO's point of view and inspection.

Richard advised no person was injured or received any electric shock. None of the passengers were present by the time the DAO arrived at site.

Richard requested several times that the DAO ask the fault crew to ""hurry up"" so he could get the balloon down. The DAO advised RIchard that the crew will do what they can as promptly as possible but that safety is the main concern and that we will wait until they give the go ahead before moving any closer to the balloon and that we need to stay at least 10m away for safety purposes.

The wind started picking up and RIchard became more and more agitated as time went on. As the Downer fault crew were driving up the road, Richard ran off to meet them and put himself in a dangerous position as he was grabbing the balloon and ropes, but at this point there was no advice from the Downer fault crew that the line was dead at this point in time. Despite the DAO's concern and words to Richard previously he had no regard for his own safety at this time and the DAO believes it was lucky that the Dower fault crew had isolated and earthed the line, thus making the line ""dead"" as RIchard assumed this, as the crew were not working on the line anymore.

The Downer fault crew did advise that the line was dead and the balloon was removed from the HV Line. 
Richard proceeded to tie down and fold up the balloon and once this was secured, the Downer fault crew began re-instating supply.

INITIAL SUMMARY OF EVENT:
On Sunday 10th April 2016 a two person, sub contract climbing crew, employed by VBL Tree Care were conducting works on behalf of Asplundh on the TGN contract. The work involved both climbing and tree felling activities. The crew was working on a property at 357 Allambee Estate Rd, Allambee. A number of mountain ash trees around 15 metres in height had been identified for removal. The wind was moderate to gusty and the crew had picked this location as the direction of the wind favoured the intended felling line. The crew was using a 3:1 mechanical advantage rigging technique to secure and tension the trees prior and to assist with the felling. The rope was attached approximately 1/3rd up from the base of the tree and secured to larger tree back in the direction of intended fall (700 – 800 away from the SWER line).
Three trees had been completed successfully using this method. The crew had comprehensively discussed and agreed on the work method to be undertaken to fell the trees. Once each tree was rigged and secured using the same 3:1 method the rope was tied off and secured using an alpine butterfly knot. Together they would then tension the tree to an agreed point where the tree lay slightly past vertical in the direction away from the SWER line. The feller would then apply the scarf, stop the saw and check with the off-sider. Once confirmed all was ok the feller would indicate he was commencing his back cut while the off-sider monitored the securing line. Once the back cut was complete the feller would return to the securing line and together they would then commence pulling the tree over. The crew have rigged a fourth tree (16m height, 350mm DBH) in the same manner however when the feller has applied the back cut he has cut to deep (overcut) which has resulted in almost all the hinge wood being removed. When he has returned to assist the off-sider to pull the tree over, the resulting force has caused the hinge wood to break clean through. This has caused the tree to overbalance, roll against an adjoining acacia tree and fall in the opposite direction and onto the SWER line.",Conductor (bare),,Trees

The following is a summary from the incident investigation report compiled by Underground Cable Systems:

UCS is the electrical contractor for the Lyndarum Estate, Stage 43A. Construction of the electrical works was conducted on the 14th and 15th April 2016.  UCS utilised a subcontractor, X-Power, for cable hauling and light column erection on this project. The work included erecting of public light columns in Highpark Drive and along Woodson Drive.  Running parallel to Woodson Drive and crossing Highpark Drive is an Electrical Transmission Line. Within the electrical design it had been identified that when installing 2 of 24W FL “TS” Greenstreet Lanterns on 5.5m mounting height “Lincoln” hinged poles in Highpark Drive the works would need to be conducted under permit. A permit was obtained for this location. Work at this location has not yet been undertaken. On 15th April an X-Power crew was undertaking the installation of Public Light Columns along Woodson Drive. No permit was specified nor obtained for the works along Woodson Drive. During the process of erecting the light column at the intersection of Woodson Drive and Wrexham Road (BID PO 2601626817) the light column was suspended from the carne truck with a synthetic sling.  Whilst positioning the column the employee guiding the pole dropped the tag-line, and whilst attempting to regain the line made contact with the suspended light column.  The worker received a shock from an apparently induced electrical charge on the column. Employee taken to nearest Emergency Department for assessment and treatment. Employee discharged with clearance to resume full duties.

"On 23 May 2016 a third party contractor performing civil works (horizontal borer) outside the West Melbourne Terminal Station dug up and damaged two cables on the WMTS – FE No.1 66,000 Volt line exit. 

There was no injuries and feeder protection operated as planned so no loss of supply occurred. This incident was reported to Jemena Coordination Centre at approximately 11:02.

A Jemena fault crew attended the work site and found that the drill had struck two phases of the High Voltage underground cable. There was minor impact to the white phase outer sheath, while the red phase cable sustained major damage, as a result, the WMTS – FE No.1 66kV line could not be repaired at the time of the fault.

Currently, Footscray East Zone Substation is running on single contingency supplying approximately 13,900 customers via the WMTS – FE No.2 66kV line. The potential risks for an outage on the WMTS – FE No.2 66kV line has been assessed, and mitigation plans have been developed and are in place.

Jemena lacks the specialist resources to perform the necessary repair works to bring the WMTS – FE No.1 66kV line back into commission. All major rectification works are being planned and carried out with assistance from Citipower and a third party specialising in oil filled cable repairs.

It is concluded that the failure of the underground cable poses a risk to supply reliability for JEN customers and that the repair of the oil filled cables on WMTS – FE No.1 66kV remains a priority to reduce the potential outages for customers supplied by Footscray East Zone Substation.",Cable,,Dug up

Craig Velt, Adam Hinss and Dean Adams of AusNet Services, attended site and discussed incident with Spiecapag Lucas staff and supervisor as well as APA (Gas Pipeline owner) HSE Rep. The staff on site advised that a 30T excavator had contacted the line after they had completed laying a new HP gas pipe in the trench directly below the line. The event happened as the machine was exiting the area where the operator lifted and slewed the machine during the exit phase from the work area. At the time the excavator operator had ceased to maintain eye contact with the spotter.

No injuries were sustained to personnel and there was no damage to conductor or machinery. Fault current at ZSS was 300A blue phase to ground. When questioned about whether the excavator driver had had a medical check the supervisor advised that the local medical officer (suspect first aider) had discussed the welfare of the operator and sent him home prior to site attendance by AusNet Services' staff. It was strongly recommended that a doctors should be consulted to assess the person.

The crew on site were asked about their understanding of the NGZ rule and requirements for PTW from AusNet Services. The crew believed that they had things covered through the use of an industry trained spotter as well as the presence of warning flags in the vicinity of the line. Adam explained the need for PTW due to the machine being large enough to encroach safe approach distances and that extra precautions could have been utilised had a proper process been followed.

It was fortunate that AusNet Services had live line sequence enabled on the protection for unrelated works on the same feeder when the event occurred. Therefore the protection operated very quickly and no reclose occurred. The crew were made aware of how fortunate they were that the protection was set this way and this was due to lucky timing rather than good management.

The cause of the fault appears to have been an explosion at the HV open point (HV isolators BH 0522) located in Dundee Street.  There were splash marks on the HV white and blue phases and a possum was the most likely cause of the fault that caused substantial damage. The HV centre phase conductor fell to the ground on the west side of the HV isolators and three bays of the HV red phase conductor was felled in Clarice Road from the HV CHP to ""Mdlboro N313 - Clarice"" and ""Clarice 31 - Mdlboro"" substations.

Secondary damage also occurred as failed HV ampact connections occurred on the blue phase conductor on the north sides of BH0592 and BH0591.

"IMS 222257. Initial Report: At 1925, OSSCA Operation at Richmond Terminal Station (RTS) shed Substation Camberwell (CL) & Substation Gardener (K), equating to approximately 50MW.

Final Report: On 2 June, 2016, switching was undertaken at Richmond Terminal Station (RTS) to isolate the Number 1 220kV busbar, which was required out of service due to the proximity of testing associated with the new 220kV Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS).
During this switching, at 19:25, OSSCA incorrectly identified an overload of the B6 Transformer, alarmed and then operated to open two 66kV circuit breakers on the 1-2 66KV bus group. This resulted in interrupting supply from RTS to the CitiPower owned Camberwell Zone Substation (CL) and United Energy owned Gardener Zone Substation (K), resulting in the loss of all load at those substations.
The significant contributing factors identified are:
o The B6 Transformer OSSCA was inadvertently armed by the controller in response to OSSCA alarms alerting overloading of the B6 Transformer during planned switching;
o The SCADA data source used for OSSCA B6 Transformer loading calculation was found to be inaccurate due to a pre-existing calculation error;
o At the time of the event, the OSSCA display used a different approach to displaying the status and operating controls than normally used in SCADA. This has now been changed in response to this event;
o The OSSCA function is armed and disarmed using a single action from the controller. The normal control function requires a two-step confirmation process;
o At RTS, 66kV current readings are available in SCADA from the two B6 transformer circuit breakers. No current readings are available in SCADA from the 66kV transformer. The 66kV current in the B6 Transformer is based on a calculation is made in SCADA which summates the absolute values of the current in the two CBs and not the vector quantities. When the B6 transformer 220KV CB is open and the B6 transformer 66kV CBs are being used as a tie between the bus groups, the calculation will give a false reading of double the individual CB current when it should give a result of almost zero Amps.
o This false reading is what OSSCA used to determine the transformer loading and consequently generated alarms indicating an overload of the B6 Transformer. The controller then selected the OSSCA display to ensure that OSSCA was disarmed and inadvertently armed the OSSCA B6 model resulting in OSSCA load shedding.",Terminal substation,System false alarm;Other,AF Other

The  ground was burnt 5cm each side of the conductor. The incident occurred in a LBRA location.

Please accept our apology that this incident was not identified by Network Safety until we did the Q1-2017 MEC quarterly report.  The IMS record had a Fire tab only and did not have the Electrical tab as required so it was initially missed. I have consulted with a Controller in the CEOT concerning electrical protection operation and there is no record of any HV protection operating in relation to this incident.  Please note a Schedule 1 report (notification) was sent to ESV by our CEOT (Control Room).

The fire had also scorched the top of the pole, however the damage was not significant enough to deem it unserviceable. The melting and fire that was on the cable had caused a significant fire on the ground. This fire was measured at 5m in width and 60m in length. Due to the location, there was no damage to property or any other AusNet Services' assets. The fire was no threat to surrounding properties. No injuries occurred.  Area was extremely dry, which contributed to the spreading of the grass fire. No wind at the time enabled the fire to be put out before it spread.

"On 11 January 2018 a customer contacted Jemena at 18:04 hrs (AEDT) to advise of the intermittent loss of supply occurring approximately five times over a 30 minute period. Jemena smart meter data supports the customer observation of the intermittent power loss. The commencement time of this event is approximately 17:26 hrs (AEDT) on 11 January 2018.

Jemena crew attended the site at approximately 20:20 hrs (AEDT) and disconnected all supply from Barrington-Parnell distribution substation.  The crew identified that transformer LV neutral dropper was broken.  

The LV neutral dropper is used to connect the overhead LV reticulated neutral conductor to the neutral bushing of the transformer (Barrington-Parnell substation) burnt off.  The dropper burnt off close to the D-Loop (split bolt) clamp at the point where the conductor is dropping (bending) and continues to connect with transformer neutral bushing and transformer LV earth conductor. 

As a result of the neutral connection failure the transformer neutral (star point) remained connected to the substation CMEN.  However, the aluminium overhead reticulated mains neutral was isolated from the CMEN star point of the transformer.  This created a condition where customers experienced over and under voltages which were observed as intermittent interruption to power supply.  

Over voltage caused damage to customer appliances at approximately 50% of the 98 residential properties supplied from Barrington-Parnell substation.

Although the exact root cause of the incident could not be determined, available evidence suggests that tree clearing conducted by a third party is the probable cause of the dropper failure.

With reference to the Tripping Incident at BTS on 06/06/2017 at 11:42 hours (No.2 220kV Bus tripped by CB Fail Protection of No.2 Transformer Group No.2 Bus CB), Installation of ABM (Active Burden Module) was recommended at RTS by Protection & Control Asset Management in order to avoid such Tripping Incident.

At RTS on Tuesday 21st November 2017, while installing and testing of ABMs in 66kV Protection & Control Panel No. G6 - FR3 FDR (New No4 66kV BUS) the following events happened. (SCADA Time):
12:23:43.714 - FR1 Y CBF Trip – ON.
12:23:27.743 – New No3 66kV Bus Y BP Trip – ON.

The reason for CBF Trip was analysed after consultation with Principal Engineer PC & A, it was confirmed the CBF settings of GE L90 relay along with the methodology of Testing the CBF function after installation of ABM module caused the Tripping.

Informed TOC the reason for tripping and the New No3 66kV BUS was normalised at 12:38:13.

Significant contributing factors identified are:
• Relay Settings-CBF Initiate Seal In Function.
• No indication of CBF Supervision pick up.
• Heavy Load on FR1 caused Current Element of relay pick up.
• BF1 – Seal In Function is ON.
• Methodology of Testing CBF function after installing ABMs.

The issue associated with the incident that, if corrected, could have prevented the incident from occurring or would have significantly reduced the consequences are:
• If CBF Supervision Pick up LED Indication was available, Tester would have noticed.
• During Installation & Testing of ABM, If current to the relay was blocked before Initiating the CBF function, relay supervision will not pick up.",Terminal substation,,AF Other

On Wednesday 29th November at approximately 09.18am, JEN 22kv TH 22 Feeder, experienced successful lockout. On further investigation initiated by Jemena Control Room, a Network Operator was dispatched to patrol JEN 22kv TH 22 Feeder line to identify any cause that may have affected the line.
While the network operator was patrolling the line, he identified a third party civil contractor carrying out civil works in the vicinity of JEN 22kv TH 22 Feeder, south of MGS 19273 Southern end of Beachley St, Tottenham. As the electrical operator entered the work site to examine the line, he was approached by a site worker who informed the electrical network operator that a machine operator had made contact with the line. 
Upon closer examination by the Network Operator, he identified burn splash marks on the top of the excavator’s boom (arm) which had made contact with JEN 22kv TH 22 Feeder conductor, and this had created burn damage on Blue Phase bare conductor from the boom contact on the line.  
The Network Operator subsequently approached the machine operator on site, who denied the incident. However, with the initial evidence was presented and the site supervisor’s validation, the Machine Operator followed on to admit to the incident.

Final report from attending DAO: Received a call as DAO regarding a fire out in Larritts lane Glenburn. The cause of the fire was a large tree branch that had come down between Pole#1401222 and Pole#1401223. The tree branch had caused the overhead high voltage line to snap in half and make contact with the ground. The fault current from when the overhead line hit the ground caused sparks to arise and a fire to start. Due to the extremely dry terrain and lake of recent rain fall the fire started quite easily. The fire spread over a large distance, firstly engulfing a nearby creek. The fire then proceed to jump over the Larrits Lane and spread near Pole#1401221. The high winds carried the fire in north easterly direction and caused severe damage to the customer’s property. No damage to any of the customer’s buildings or sheds occurred. In total 3 separate paddocks were damaged by a fire. The CFA had controlled and put the fire out by the time I had arrived. The fault current caused the ACR at the SWER isolating transformer to trip.

"A new unit development was being constructed at 6 St Aubins Avenue with a new pole type substation installed to supply the site.  Part of the electricity supply offer was a HV extension from existing HV infrastructure to the pole type substation.  Private trees were required to be cut to ensure clearances are maintained to the new HV conductors and the builder was instructed the tree cutting activities are within a No Go Zone and do not proceed and arrange for a site assessment.

United Energy’s Vegetation Liaison Officer inspected this site and provided the following information to the builder… 
 
""I have inspected the site and can provide the below advice.  The overhang in the below picture will need to be removed prior to the new HV being constructed and energised.  As per the approved design drawing, there is an offset type construction which indicated the inner HV phase will be in line with the centre of the poles.  The customer will need to arrange for a NGZ Live Line quote or Shutdown in order for their arborist to safely remove this overhang whilst eliminating damage or an outage to our network. The crew will prune back to a clearance of 3m which is more than ample as the required clearance for HV in a Low Bush Fire Risk Area is 2m plus re-growth pending on the length of the span.  Overhang is permitted within a Low Bushfire Risk Area but the minimum 2m clearance plus re-growth is still required.  Just to clarify I believe this requires a NGZ raised as access to the tree will be breached as there is a 3m minimum required clearance for any persons not working directly for UE (Unauthorised Persons) under the VESI No Go Zone requirements.  No Go Zone can be contacted at 132 099"".

Tony (Extec Services) issued a permit to Adam Rawsthown (tel. 0408 168944) 8/2/2018 to 8/3/2018 as attached. At Tony's site visits Winslow were requesting to work adjacent to poles and under lines to install pipes, conduits, etc. and at no time did they indicate they would be permanently removing soil for retaining walls and changing heights of ground level. We would expect they backfill after excavation and pipe install. If and when customers/contractors advise they are changing ground levels or removing significant soil around poles we would refer them back to AusNet Services. The PTW outlined clearances to overhead lines, conditions with excavating adjacent to cables and the excavation depths next to poles. In this instance Tony gave them a PTW that requested they not excavate greater than 300mm within 600mm, not greater than 900mm within 600mm to 1500mm and not greater than 1800mm within 1500mm to 1800mm. This is exactly as per NGZ guidelines for Network Operator's chart. For your information this chart is a guideline only and in some cases we alter what we allow based on pole type, forces on pole, soil type, earths, etc. I believe they have not followed their permit to work and have not indicated to us they are changing soil levels and discussions were around excavating and re-instating.",Pole (wood),,Other

Final report: 
On the 18th of March 2018 at approximately 13:29hrs AEST, the Morwell Terminal Station to Yallourn Power Station (MWTS-YPS) No 1 66kV Line tripped from its line protection.

There was a white phase - blue phase fault on the line. At MWTS end, both X (SEL311L) and Y (Siemens 7SD610) protection current differential protection operated. Fault current was 8.8kA peak and CB opened in 89ms. At YPS end, both X (SEL311L) and Y (Siemens 7SD610) protection current differential protection operated. Fault current was 2.1kA peak and CB opened in 98ms. Auto reclose functions are not provided for circuit breakers of this line.
 
The Line remained out of service from the time of the tripping until the following day.
 
On the 19th of March 2018, a patrol of the line was undertaken and due to site access difficulties approximately 90% of the line was completed with no cause found.
The line was restored to service on the 19th of March 2018 at approximately 12:15hrs.
The line tripped approximately six minutes later at 12:21hrs from its line protection.
There was a red phase -earth fault on the line. According to oscillograph downloaded from relays at both ends, the fault was only fed from YPS end with a peak value of 610A.
There was negligible fault current from MWTS end until the last 3 cycles of the event where fault current has risen to 160A.
In this event, Y protection (Siemens 7SD610) at both ends operated. X protection (SEL311L) at both ends did not operate. This is due to the different algorithms used in the two protection schemes, which have different sensitivities under different fault scenarios.

"IMS233305. Initial report:Report of sparking power lines and a grass fire. Report of a possible contact by an excavator.

Final report by attending DAO:
I arrived on site at approx. 1445hrs following reports of LV wires sparking and starting a small grass fire and observed the following scene. There was a span of Open wire LV approx. 50m in length, crossing a road and a paddock. On the Western side of the LV (approx. 1.5m from, and parallel to, the conductor line) was a temporary construction fence approx. enclosing a parcel of land on which there was a sizeable area of excavation being preparation for a building foundation. Midway along this fence (provided by Super Safe Hire - tel 1300 132 731) was a sign indicating an Access Gate. There were no vehicles or plant on site, but there were excavator track marks running through this gate. These track marks extended to meet with truck wheel marks that were parallel with the line approx. 15-20m to the east. There were two burnt patches of grass, one approx. 4m x 6m and the other approx. 8m by 8m, both directly beneath the LV line and separated by approx. 15m of unburnt grass. Both burnt patches had excavator track marks and bucket scraping marks through them. I scanned the LV conductors with binoculars looking for any evidence of scorching or arcing and found no such evidence. Whilst I was on site, a member of the public approached me and claimed to live approx. 3 properties south of the incident site (at the end of the LV line). He said he heard a loud crack and some, but not all, of his power went out. He looked out at the LV line and saw it swaying. He came out to investigate, saw the fires and came down to assist with extinguishing them. He claimed that the excavator was well clear of the conductors when the operator heard a loud crack and turned to see two separate fires had started behind him. He was adamant that there was no burn marks / damage to the excavator. I didn't get the name / details of the member of the public, but he was driving a Nissan Patrol with the registration SWN071.",Conductor (bare),,Vehicle

"On the 3/10/18 Jemena identified that during the third party construction stages of a commercial building in Holt Parade (Next door to 210 Holt Parade), Thomastown, The integrity of the live electrical overhead assets had been compromised. Firstly the builder (Leo) has reduced the clearance between ground and the live 66kV overhead cable by backfilling (raising) the ground beneath the Jemena overhead cables. Secondly the builder has removed two ground stay wires which were used to secure electrical pole, causing the pole to move/lean, lowering the height of the live 66kV overhead cable between the 2 adjacent poles. Both of these actions have resulted in the live 66kV overhead cable lowering to a ground height of 4.8 meters between one bay and 6 meters between another bay, below the 6.7 meter minimum ground clearance required. Jemena can provide evidence in October 2017 these ground clearances were confirmed to be at the required heights. A site assessment conducted indicated, while the pole is at no immediate risk of falling the pole needs to be supported as soon as practicable. De-energisation of the live cable is not deemed practicable as this could result in the loss of power to a large number of customers and critical infrastructure. Immediately after 4 Jemena technical specialist left the holt parade worksite and passing along the adjacent Dalton road at 8:40 on the 4/10/18. it was observed that work had recommenced using two scissor lifts adjacent to the overhead power lines within the 3-6.4 meter no go zone informed to the builder.

"Hi Teams,

Zinfra has attended the above site today and found several issues with one being a very significant issue. 

1.	The REC has disconnected and altered the installation wiring with the metering (yet to be metered ) tails having been removed from the main control circuit breakers to units 1-2-3-4-5 and re-supplied from a circuit breaker on the previously metered and energised public lighting switchboard which has connected and energised the units.
The units cannot be metered until the wiring has been reinstated and the appropriate certificate/certificates of electrical safety provided.

2.	The unused holes in the meter panel need to be filled.

3.	The permanent unit numbers need to be displayed at the entrance to each unit.
(Builder has numbers on site fitting 8/2/19).

4.	The door to the room containing the main switchboard and metering needs to be suitably labelled.

5.	Unit 2 service order requests single phase metering, the meter panel has been wired for three phase.

This is the second time this has occurred on this site. On the first occasion the REC was given a talking to about connecting and energising the installation from alternative sources of supply and advised not to do this particularly when there is a request for the Electricity Distributor to attend to meter and connect supply.

"Crews have attended the above address today at 9 Snyder Ct Tullamarine with a SO for a new connection for a new 3ph UG permanent supply.
The neighbouring property at 11 Snyder Ct was carded and notified last week due to the UG pit located on the property boundary between numbers 9 & 11 Snyder Ct only having single port connecters and a 1ph UG supply servicing number 11 Snyder Ct.
When the crews attended today they found a builders temporary supply (BTS) pole at number 11 Snyder Ct supplied underground (UG) with a 1ph supply and an old analogue meter (8163645) on the BTS pole and the address on the meter panel labelled as 9 Snyder Ct. Further this this I made contact with Kerrie from CPC who advised that the meter number 8163645 is registered to number 9 Snyder Ct and not number 11 Snyder Ct. Further to this JenViewer shows an existing UG service to number 9 Snyder Ct and no UG service to number 11 Snyder Ct.

Prior to today’s TA, Compliance Officer had spoken to the REC on the phone on 2 occasions when the REC had called the compliance line. On the first occasion it was explained to the REC the min boundary crossing requirements, min driveway clearance heights for his and the neighbouring property, max raiser bracket service angle (60 deg open hook, 70 deg closed loop), clearance from other assets (communications cable), the requirement for 2 TA’s if all works could not be completed within a single 1hr TA and not to disconnect and remove distributors metering equipment and assets if re-using the same metering position. 
On the second occasion the REC called to request a midspan connection from an open wire service on the same side of the road with communication services on a catenary wire directly below the distributors open wire service to which he was explained no we cannot provide you with this type of connection and all the above information from the first telephone call was reiterated to him. 
On both occasions the REC fully acknowledged that he understood everything the was explained to him and advised that his new 3ph OH supply will comply with the VSIR’s and Jemena policy requirements and he would book 2 TA’s (disconnect & reconnect).

When the crews arrived today they found and assessed:

1.	Only a single TA had been booked and scheduled for 11.00am
2.	The REC had removed the existing 1ph service fuse, removed the existing distributors 1ph meter which was laying on the ground, removed the existing metering panel and wiring and had installed a new metering panel  in the existing location along with new 3ph mains to a new POA location and 900mm open hook type raiser bracket.
3.	The new 3ph overhead service exceeded the max boundary crossing requirement of 2m down the adjoining neighbouring property. This was measured at approx. 2.4m. Although not a major issue however there is customer vegetation below the OH service line
4.	The overhead service clearance was a max 4.2 over the driveway (min 4.6m required)
5.	The OH service angle from the raiser bracket POA exceeded the max 60deg for an open hook type and 70deg for closed loop type and was pulling the raiser at an almost 90deg angle.

"Planned work was to be undertaken for the replacement of a HV/LV pole (A008424) in Newsome Street and HV cross arm replacement on pole A008423 in Newsome corner of Walter Street Ascot Vale.
This required the isolation of HV and LV supplies to Hurtle-Newsom S/Stn, with all affected customers confirmed as notified. HV supply was also required to be isolated to Hillside-Hurtle S/Stn and Harold Hurtle S/Stn’s. LV parallels were closed in accordance with the LV parallel list and marked up diagrams and substation LV isolators opened as per the switching instruction. 
At approximately 07:58hrs the Electricity Network Operator (ENO) in accordance with switching instruction (SWI # 67724 - Step 17) isolated the Low Voltage circuits at Harold-Hurtle S/Stn. A short time later a customer notified the crews on site that no customer notification had been given for the outage. The ENO in discussion with the Network Operations Supervisor confirmed that the LV parallels for Harold Hurtle S/Stn had been omitted. The SWI was amended to include two additional LV parallels, these two open points were closed and supply was restored to the affected customers. The ENO continued to switch the network as per the SWI. 
As a result of this switching error the interruption affected 92 customers for approximately 3 minutes. No special needs or life support customers were affected by this outage.",Transformer,,Other

Faults crew advised that the overhead service line, SEC fuse assemblies, point of supply connection point and customer mains showed no signs of deterioration and looked in very good condition for its age.
Installing a new raiser bracket, FOLCB and mains cabling is customer initiated prescribed installation work and the REC did not have a prescribed COES, he only had a non prescribed COES.

In the process of the pole falling the vehicle drove into the falling outreach bracket attached at the top of the pole, resulting in damage to the vehicle’s windshield and A-pillar.",Pole (steel),,Vehicle
