                        <ul>
                            <li> To figure out if there is any place that
                                has high vegetation contact related incident rate
                                but low inspection rate or vice versa
                            </li>
                            <li> To profile non-compliant cases and to check if
                                there are any trends or patterns
                            </li>
                            <li> To build a recommender for locations of next year inspections
                            </li>
                        </ul>
